# NIEM: Our Sharing Spot

[NIEM](https://niemgov) is a community-driven, standards-based approach to exchanging information. Leveraging open source collaborative environments allows the program to foster growth, operate more efficiently and provide a way for those who use NIEM to provide meaningful contributions.

NIEM follows these principles when developing new projects:

1.	Use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), which is software that does not charge users a purchase or licensing fee for modifying or redistributing the source code, in our projects and and maintain FOSS in a location that is freely accessible to all potential contributors.
2.	Create an environment where any project can be developed in the open and encourage broad participation.    
3.	Promote adoption of FOSS licensing models across all NIEM stakeholders.


## Benefits

Using FOSS allows for product customization, advances interoperability between tools, and improves the overall quality of the final product. Other benefits include:

1. **Flexible usage.** The benefits of using FOSS compel NIEM to meet citizen and business needs by modifying existing or creating new FOSS. FOSS is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping and experimentation. The testing process generates minimal costs, and the process encourages the identification and elimination of defects not recognized by the original development team.

1. **Community involvement.** Publicly available source code enables continuous and broad peer review. Whether simply publishing the completed code or opening the development process, the practice of expanding the review and testing process to a wider audience—beyond the development team—ensures increased software reliability and security. Developing in the open also allows for other opinions to help adjust the direction of a product to maximize its usefulness to the community it serves.

1. **Cost-savings.**  The ability to modify FOSS enables NIEM to respond rapidly to changing missions and markets. Support and maintenance of open source code—as opposed to more burdensome usages of proprietary software—provides a real cost advantage where multiple copies of software are required, or when the user base grows. The total cost of ownership is shared with a community, rather than solely NIEM.

1. **Reusability.**  The code we create belongs to the American people as a part of the public domain. The code we work on was paid for by the American people, but the end-product is not the only way they should be able to interact with their government. By coding in FOSS, we help populate a larger commons that cities, states, businesses, and citizens can participate in. This creates real economic value by lowering the burden of replicating similar work or by allowing the private sector to build off of and create new businesses around code developed by NIEM.

1. **Transparency.**	NIEM encourages transparency in order to foster community trust as well as new and innovative ideas.

1. **Marketplace of Ideas.**  The use of FOSS ensures that NIEM is not limited to the ideas and innovations of any one entity.  Rather, NIEM can evolve and accomodate new and disruptive ideas as well as provide a collaborative space for those ideas to grow and be defined.


## Maximizing Community Involvement and Reuse

Active involvement from the open source community is integral to the success of open source code. NIEM will be an active contributor to FOSS projects that it or its stakeholders utilize, whether they are maintained or operated by NIEM.

Code written entirely by NIEM staff will be dedicated to the public domain. In addition, any contracts or grants NIEM enters into, where others will develop software on NIEM’s behalf, will ensure that all results are dedicated to the public domain. In general, all discussion in this document about the licensing of work of NIEM’s contractors or grantees means that NIEM will ensure that their contracts or grants guarantee those terms.

NIEM encourages contributions to its open source projects, whether it be code, commentary, bug reports, feature requests, or overall strategic direction.

Forks or clones of our code repositories are free to be re-distributed. This means code created by NIEM can be integrated into work that is under a more restrictive license, even those that are not considered open source licenses.

This changes when our code repositories include code that was not created by NIEM and carries an open license. Code previously released under an open source license and then modified by NIEM or its contractors is considered a ["joint work"] [4] and must be released under the terms of the original open source license.

The public can use our code as the basis of wholly proprietary and commercial systems. NIEM would appreciate that users of our code disclose its lineage, but NIEM maintains no legal right to require disclosure. Notifications that our work is used in a new system are always greatly appreciated.

## Open Source Licenses

As previously mentioned, most work generated at NIEM falls within the U.S. public domain.

For our international colleagues, NIEM also permanently waives all copyright and related rights worldwide to code created by NIEM or its contractors and grantees.

Our [default LICENSE file](LICENSE.md) for projects acknowledges that our work is in the US public domain, and uses [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) to waive copyright internationally.

Our [default CONTRIBUTING file](CONTRIBUTING.md) informs contributors that their contributions will be licensed under the same terms.

However, certain projects will require the usage of licensed open source software not created by NIEM. Some open source licenses make source code available under different terms and conditions. These terms and conditions specify how the code may be used, modified, or shared. When users modify NIEM code, they should review and understand the terms of the open source license in question.

Each project may need to modify or extend the above LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING files as needed for its own circumstances.

## Distribution of Code

There is a misconception that FOSS that is distributed to the public should not be integrated or modified for use in sensitive systems. On the contrary, FOSS is often preferred for use in sensitive systems, due in part to its increased auditability. In other words, security in FOSS must be designed never to rely on obscurity in how the code works.

In addition, many open source licenses permit the user to modify open source software for internal use without obligating them to distribute source code to the public. However, if the user chooses to distribute the modified open source software outside the user's organization, then it is subject to whatever license it carries.

## Exceptions

The only conditions where code shall not be released or developed in the open are:

* The U.S. Government does not have the rights to reproduce and release the item.

* The public release of the item is restricted by other law or regulation, such as the Export Administration Regulations or the International Traffic in Arms Regulation.

These decisions will be made as needed by the NIEM Program Management Office, with input from the NIEM Technical Architectrure Committee and NIEM Business Architecture Committee, as needed. Any further exemptions will be rare, documented publicly, and the result of compelling interest.

If an existing solution cannot be found in the open source community, NIEM may consider other options, including creating an open source solution itself. Ultimately, the software that best meets the needs and mission of NIEM should be used.

## Thanks

NIEM would like to thank YOU for supporting us and the possibilities that exist for this community.

For the NIEM newbies, welcome.  You have just joined a great community that spans all levels of government  and the private sector, working on some of the most important issues in society today.
